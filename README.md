To run, you just need to move into the main folder on your computer (i.e. /home/username/downloads/Spin_Animation)
Then run the command "python UI_init.py"

At least that's how it works on my computer.  It may not work on yours without the proper libraries installed.  Then main one you might need is Open3d, which is easily downloaded from its website.

The program bugs out if you try to quit the animation while it's playing.  You can change the length of the video in the UI_init file.
